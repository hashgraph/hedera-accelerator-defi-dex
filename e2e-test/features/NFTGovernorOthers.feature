Scenario: NFTGovernor flow
    Given User creates the Governor for token-id "0.0.2726474"
    When User initializes the contracts
    Then User verify the initialization
    When User setup "12" tokens allowance for Locking
    When User lock "12" tokens in token holder for voting
    Then User verify the locked tokens in token holder
    
Scenario: Text proposal execution
    Given User setup allowance for proposal creation with amount/id "11"
    When User create a text proposal where title is "E2E-Text-Proposal" 
    When User votes "For" proposal    
    Then User waits for proposal state to be "Succeeded" for max 40 seconds    
    Then User execute the proposal with fee "0"

Scenario: FT token create proposal
    Given User setup allowance for proposal creation with amount/id "11"
    When User create a token-create proposal with name & symbol "E2E-Test-Token" and initial value "10e8" where fee "30e8" 
    When User votes "For" proposal    
    Then User waits for proposal state to be "Succeeded" for max 40 seconds   
    Then User execute the proposal with fee "30e8"
    When User fetch last created token
    Then User verify token supply amount "10e8"

Scenario: FT token mint proposal
    Given User setup allowance for proposal creation with amount/id "11"
    When User create a token-mint proposal with value "5e8"  
    When User votes "For" proposal    
    Then User waits for proposal state to be "Succeeded" for max 40 seconds   
    Then User execute the proposal with fee "0"
    Then User verify token supply amount "15e8"

Scenario: FT token burn proposal
    Given User setup allowance for proposal creation with amount/id "11"
    When User create a token-burn proposal with value "2e8"  
    When User votes "For" proposal    
    Then User waits for proposal state to be "Succeeded" for max 40 seconds   
    Then User execute the proposal with fee "0"
    Then User verify token supply amount "13e8"

Scenario: Contract's logic upgrade proposal
    Given User setup allowance for proposal creation with amount/id "11"
    When User create a contract-logic upgrade proposal proxy is "0.0.2621261" and logic is "0.0.2621239"
    When User votes "For" proposal    
    Then User waits for proposal state to be "Succeeded" for max 40 seconds
    When User transfer ownership of proxy to assets-holder
    Then User execute the proposal with fee "0"
    Then User verify proxy logic address

Scenario: Run cleanup task
    When User run cleanup task
