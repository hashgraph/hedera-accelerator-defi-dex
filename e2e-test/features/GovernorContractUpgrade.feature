        When User setup 10001 as allowance amount for token locking for contract upgrade proposal
        When User setup default allowance for contract upgrade proposal creation
        When User get the current logic address of factory contract 
        When User deploy the contract "Factory" 
        When User create a new contract upgrade proposal with title "proposalforcontractupgrade1xy"

        When User wait for upgrade proposal state to be "Executed" for max 5 seconds  
        When User get the address of target contract from governor upgrade contract
        When User upgrade the contract    
        Then User verify logic address of target factory contract is different before and after upgrade

    Scenario: Verify proposal is executed even if user gives same contract to upgrade
        When User get the current logic address of factory contract 
        When User setup 10001 as allowance amount for token locking for contract upgrade proposal

        When User get the address of target contract from governor upgrade contract

        When User deploy the contract "Factory" 
        When User setup 10001 as allowance amount for token locking for contract upgrade proposal
        When User setup default allowance for contract upgrade proposal creation
        When User create a new contract upgrade proposal with title "proposalforcontractupgrade4w42xy"
        When User wait for upgrade proposal state to be "Active" for max 5 seconds
        Then User verify that proposal current state is "Active"
        When User lock 10001 GOD token before voting to contract upgrade proposal
        When User vote "Against" contract upgrade proposal
        When User wait for upgrade proposal state to be "Defeated" for max 15 seconds    
        When User cancel the contract upgrade proposal with title "proposalforcontractupgrade4w42xy" 
        Then User verify logic address of target contract is not changed        

    Scenario: Verify contract is not upgraded if no body voted on it 
        When User get the current logic address of factory contract

        When User cancel the contract upgrade proposal with title "proposalforcontractupgrade524xwy" 
        Then User verify logic address of target contract is not changed

      Scenario: Verify contract is not upgraded on proposal cancellation
        When User get the current logic address of factory contract
        When User deploy the contract "Factory" 
        When User setup 10001 as allowance amount for token locking for contract upgrade proposal
        When User setup default allowance for contract upgrade proposal creation
